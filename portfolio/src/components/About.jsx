      <p>
        I'm Iago Porto, a software engineer who loves turning complex requirements into
        smooth-running systems. Tech stack? I'm tool-agnostic; whether it's Java/Spring, Django or
        PostgreSQL, I'll pick what fits the task. Early on, I started out tinkering with small projects;
        now I help design and maintain full-stack platforms for automotive testing and industrial automation.
      
      </p>

      <p>
        In my roles at Technica Engineering and Imatia, I've rolled out new features, set up CI/CD pipelines,
        and bridged backend services with React, JavaFX or Android frontends. Along the way, I've optimized
        SQL queries, containerized workflows, and even refined user interfacesâ€”always aiming for reliability
        and a clean developer experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        I work best in agile teams where collaboration and continuous improvement come first. Whether it's
        refactoring legacy code, sketching out microservices or experimenting with hexagonal architecture,
        I'm driven by solving real-world problems and learning the next best practice.
