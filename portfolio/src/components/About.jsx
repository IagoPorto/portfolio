      <p>
        I&apos;m Iago Porto, a versatile software engineer who enjoys making
        complex systems look effortless. I care about building solutions that
        aren&apos;t just technically correct, but profitable: reducing costs,
        removing friction, and improving the user experience so the product
        can actually grow.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tech stack? I use whatever helps us win. From Java/Spring and Python/Django to
        PostgreSQL, React or Android. I adapt to what the project needs and
        keep an eye on maintainability and best practices, because shipping
        fast is great, but maintaining what we build should be even faster.
      </p>

      <p>
        In companies like Technica Engineering and Imatia, I&apos;ve delivered new
        features end&ndash;to&ndash;end, automated pipelines, and connected backend
        services with desktop and web frontends. I focus on clean architecture
        and long&ndash;term value: every refactor, query optimization or CI step is
        one step closer to a product that scales.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I&apos;m not writing code, you can probably find me climbing,
        somewhere in a mountain, or trying not to misidentify a mushroom.
